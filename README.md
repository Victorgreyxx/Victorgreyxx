- 👋 Hi, I’m @Victorgreyxx
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code and build softwares. I have little or no idea in this field, basically I'd love someone who can put me through just about anything, trying to atleast make a passion out of something in life.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing at the moment. I'm a newbie on this, trying to be productive.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on absolutely anything that's got to do with tech.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email- victormaxwell62@gmail.com
